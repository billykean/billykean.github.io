		<h1><u><b>Lifeguard</b></h1></u>
		I think being a lifeguard is a major part of my life. It is a good job and a great opportunity to better others and myself. It teaches me responsibility first because I have to survey the pool and make sure no one drowns. In addition, it teaches me responsibility because I have to show up to work on time. I feel that being a lifeguard has made me grow up fast and shape me into the person I am today.

		<h1><u><b>Swim Instructor</b></h1></u>
		Being a Swim Instructor (SI) is what it sounds like. My job is to teach people from the ages of 3 or 4 to grown adults how to get acclimated to the water and to swim in it. I mostly work with kids around the ages of 7 or 8 and I specifically start to teach them freestyle and backstroke. I enjoy it because it gives me a different perspective that I can affect someones life by teaching them a skill.

		<h1><u><b>Volunteer</b></h1></u>
		I love volunteering, it makes me feel like I am a part of something bigger than myself. I volunteer at my local YMCA with the adult special needs classes. I also volunteer with the life skills kids right here in my school either through SADD club or just on my own will because I enjoy working with them. Volunteering with this has changed my perception on life and that's why I am going to major in Special Education.
